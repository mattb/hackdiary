This week the [London Flash Platform User Group][1] ran an evening of iPhone developer talks. My talk, &#8220;iPhone Coding For Web Developers&#8221; seemed to go down well. As a web developer, I&#8217;ve found the iPhone development environment exciting in its power and possibilities, but also perplexing in its lack of basic facilities that I&#8217;d take for granted in a modern dynamic language. This talk (based on a [previous blog post here][2]) goes into some detail about how I use HTTP, JSON and other web-oriented tech in my iPhone work.
