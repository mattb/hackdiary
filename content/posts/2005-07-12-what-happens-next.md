I&#8217;m very excited. At the end of September I&#8217;ll be leaving the BBC after more than four years of productive and fascinating work with digital television, radio and the internet.

I&#8217;ll be sad to leave the company of so many [informed][1], [intelligent][2] and [engaging][3] colleagues (to link just three), and more than anything I will miss my team. Paul Clifford, [Matt Patterson][4] and Matthew Wood are three of the most talented individuals I&#8217;ve ever worked with.

What happens next? I don&#8217;t know. I haven&#8217;t yet arranged a next step. Perhaps you have interesting work for [a software designer and developer][5], in which case you should [email me][6] to talk about it right away.
