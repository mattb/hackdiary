The first [Thinglink][1] technical workshop took place in Amsterdam this month. [Ulla-Maaria Mutanen][2] and I spent an incredibly productive week at the [Mediamatic][3] offices thrashing out ideas that will form a Thinglink technical whitepaper over the next few months.

I&#8217;d like to highlight two things in particular that came out of this activity.

Firstly, I wrote up some ideas on the Thinglink blog entitled [Design patterns for building with web APIs][4]. This came out of a discussion on the different kinds of integration model that occur in a Web 2.0 world. Although the patterns are described using stories from a Thinglink perspective, I think they&#8217;re generally applicable. I&#8217;d be interested in hearing anyone&#8217;s thoughts on how they can be refined, and whether they seem to fit the kinds of systems you&#8217;re building.

Secondly, go take a look at the [Thingtagging][5] site. It&#8217;s an aggregator for photos on flickr that have been [thingtagged][6]. We think it&#8217;s a lot of fun. We also think that you should start thinglinking and thingtagging your unique and interesting objects right now.

I&#8217;d like to thank [Tom Coates][7] not only for the gorgeous design of the site, but also for pointing out that &#8216;mashup&#8217; is really quite a tired word these days. We think that an exquisite combination of two great services deserves better, and so we name this a Flickr/Thinglink _intimacy_.
