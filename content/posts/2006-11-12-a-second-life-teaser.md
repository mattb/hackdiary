This month my freelance work takes me to [Nature Publishing Group][1] to work on a new scientific project in [Second Life][2]. We&#8217;re not quite ready to talk about what we&#8217;re doing yet, but I&#8217;m so pleased with a bit of work in progress that I thought I&#8217;d put a teaser up here.

Many people find the creation of 3D models in SL to be rather tricky. This is because there&#8217;s no built-in way to import polygon data as a mesh of 3D coordinates from an external modelling tool. Imagine if there was a factory object that could read a list of coordinates and spit out the results straight into the world, like a virtual [3D printer][3]. As part of this project, I&#8217;m working on exactly that.

_Update: As I suspected, I&#8217;m not the first to attempt this kind of work, although it looks like I&#8217;m only the second or the third. Although I had a good look around before starting to code, it wasn&#8217;t until I published this post that a couple of people contacted me to point out [this Second Life forum post][4] which provides a scripts for doing much the same thing._

To try out my new system, I went looking for entertaining test data. I have fond memories of [Quakeworld][5] &#8211; it was the first multiplayer online game that I spent a lot of time playing, and it got me through my finals. Remember this guy?

There are plenty of [handy tools][7] out there that can unpack the Quake data files and extract the models into easy-to-parse polygons formats. So, here&#8217;s my Second Life test rendering:

There&#8217;s plenty of work still to do, and lots more to say, but I&#8217;ll leave it there for now.
