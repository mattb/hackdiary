A new experience today: I&#8217;ve done my first bit of paid writing. It&#8217;s [about del.icio.us][1] again, and it&#8217;s on xml.com.

It&#8217;s an expanded version of [two][2] [previous][3] posts previously made to hackdiary. It goes into a little more detail about how the code works, and gives more examples. There&#8217;s also more analysis, and more of an introduction for the uninitiated.

It&#8217;s a bit weird reading my text on another site after it&#8217;s been edited by someone else. I&#8217;ve never been entirely comfortable with the written word; I&#8217;m more of a face-to-face person, and I think better out loud than at a keyboard. When I [started][4] posting on this site, one of my goals was to get used enough to writing that I&#8217;d feel able to tackle articles, conference papers and the like. It&#8217;s good to be getting somewhere with that.
