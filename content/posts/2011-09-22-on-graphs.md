I&#8217;ve been working on an in-depth post for this blog about graph data and how to analyse it. That post is still unfinished but I&#8217;ve been posting pieces of work-in-progress on other sites during the process. Here are some pointers to bring them together:<img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6128/5923004341_3f0f4e2cd5_m.jpg" style="float:right" /> 

  * [A Flickr set of Gephi graph visualisations that analyse, cluster and visualise datasets from Delicious, Twitter, Dopplr and Wikipedia][1] 
  * [A zoomable exploration of the topics in the 2012 SXSW panel picker][2] and [some notes on how it was made][3]. 
  * [Visualising the whole world of conference topics with Lanyrd data][4] 
  * [Slides from an Ignite talk at Strata Summit NYC that uses Nokia geo data to draw a new map of the world: Place graphs are the new social graphs][5]
