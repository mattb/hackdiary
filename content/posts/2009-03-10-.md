Since Rails established the de facto way of making websites in the Ruby world, other people have been exploring the limits of how little code you need to make a useful framework. I&#8217;ve found a very pleasing combination of independent projects that can be glued together to make very tiny web apps very quickly.

Consider this function that adds two numbers:

> `def add_up(a,b)<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;c = a.to_i + b.to_i<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;"#{a} + #{b} = #{c}"<br />
    end`

Now imagine we&#8217;d like to web-enable this function &#8211; so we can GET it over HTTP. Enter [Sinatra][1] and a couple of small changes to the existing code:

> `require 'sinatra'<br />
    get '/add_up/:a/:b' do<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;a = params[:a]<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;b = params[:b]<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;c = a.to_i + b.to_i<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;"#{a} + #{b} = #{c}"<br />
    end`

Save this as add\_up.rb, then run it with ruby. Hit https://127.0.0.1:4567/add\_up/1/2 in your web browser and you&#8217;re done.

Now we&#8217;ve got our useful tiny app, we&#8217;ll want to deploy it on a server so the whole internet can enjoy it. We could run this sinatra process on a port by itself, but if we want to incorporate it into an existing serving setup then we can wrap it with the [Rack][2] interface (which Sinatra supports). This lets us configure the setup easily, and lets us plug it into a wide range of standard webservers.

The simplest way to do that is to make a second file, config.ru:

> `require 'add_up.rb'<br />
    run Sinatra::Application`

Type &#8216;rackup&#8217; to check it works. Rack&#8217;s default port is 9292 so you&#8217;ll now see your app at https://127.0.0.1:4567/add_up/1/2

Now we&#8217;ve got a rack setup, we can slot this tiny bit of web functionality into a larger setup that we might already have on our hosting. This used to mean setting up a permanently-running process and then proxying to it from our webserver. For tiny apps this was a lot of clunky setup, but happily now we have [Phusion Passenger][3] for Apache. The beautifully-engineered two-step install procedure is to type &#8220;`gem install passenger`&#8221; followed by &#8220;`passenger-install-apache2-module`&#8220;, and follow the instructions.

> `response['Expires'] = (Time.now + 60*60*24*356*3).httpdate<br />
    response['Cache-Control'] = 'public'`

> `require 'rack/cache'<br />
    use Rack::Cache,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;:metastore   => 'memcached://localhost:11211',<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;:entitystore => 'memcached://localhost:11211'`

One thing missing from the code above is data persistence. We didn&#8217;t need it for our add-these-numbers app, but even tiny web apps can benefit from storage. Two places to look are [Datamapper][4] for traditional SQL storage (perhaps with sqlite), or [memcachedb][5] for ultra-fast, super-simple key/value data.
