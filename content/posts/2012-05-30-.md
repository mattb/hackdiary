Recently I was invited by Gerd Kortuem to teach [a class at the Saïd Business School][1] in his Software Entrepreneurship module. The topic was &#8220;Big Data and Mobile&#8221;, two topics that are full of buzzwords and hype. I tried to present a view that goes beyond &#8230;

### What does mobile really mean?

### What does big data really mean?

> **Big data** is a term applied to data sets whose size is beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture, manage, and process the data within a tolerable elapsed time.

[WEF Report][4]

>   * Personal data – digital data created by and about people – represents a new economic “asset class”, touching all aspects of society.
>   * The abundance of personal data represents untapped opportunities for economic growth and social benefit; however, the barriers restricting personal data’s movement and protection need to be resolved.

> The value of big data to an organization falls into two categories: **analytical use**, and **enabling new products**.

> **Machine Learning** turns out to be a very hot technology. Every company and government in the world is drowning in data, and Machine Learning is the prime tool for actually using it to do interesting things.
