It&#8217;s nearly time to return to London for a pause and a stretch. Since I [quit my job at the BBC][1] almost exactly a year ago, I&#8217;ve spent 4 months snowboarding, attended 6 conferences and spoken at 3 (LIFT06, ETech, SXSW, XTech, Railsconf and Foocamp), [worked on at least 5 freelance contracts][2], lived in 3 different countries (France, Holland and the USA) and spent time in at least 5 others (Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Finland). I&#8217;ve travelled more than 40,000 miles by air, taken a flight every 2 weeks on average, and probably met more people in one year than in all the previous years of my life put together.

Although it&#8217;s no substitute for simply avoiding wasteful airtravel, after doing the calculations for this post I paid for a15,000 lbs CO2 <a>carbon offset from TerraPass.</p>

  <br /> My final stop on the current journey is the <a href="https://www.nearfield.org/2006/06/workshop-near-field-interactions">Near Field Interactions workshop</a> at NordiCHI in Oslo. I&#8217;ll be representing <a href="https://thinglink.org/">Thinglink</a> along with <a href="https://www.hobbyprincess.com">Ulla-Maaria Mutanen</a>.

  On October 17th I&#8217;ll be back in my own flat in Hackney, East London and considering my next steps. 2007 has a lot to live up to. Of course, the planning for <a href="https://xtech06.usefulinc.com/">XTech 2007</a> has already begun and I&#8217;ve just submitted my talk proposal for <a href="https://conferences.oreillynet.com/et2007/">next year&#8217;s ETech</a>.
