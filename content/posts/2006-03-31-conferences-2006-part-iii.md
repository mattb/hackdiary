No sooner have I returned from my USA trip than I have to think about the next steps. I now have two exciting speaking engagements and a couple of fun side-trips planned. I&#8217;ve decided not to return to living in London once the snowboarding season is over; I&#8217;m going to go wherever work and speaking takes me, and take a month or two living in each place along the way. I&#8217;m very much looking forward to taking on freelance work and getting back to making things on the internet again.

Latest itinerary:

  * 1-8 April &#8211; [Snowbombing][2] in Mayrhofen, Austria with some much-missed clubbing mates from London
  * 24 April &#8211; return to London for some meetings and to drop off my winter gear
  * 29 April &#8211; relocate to Amsterdam
  * 16-19 May &#8211; [XTech 2006][3]. I&#8217;ll be co-teaching the [Get Started with Ruby on Rails][4] tutorial with [Edd Dumbill][5] and speaking on [Putting the BBC&#8217;s Programme Catalogue on Rails][6]
  * 14-18 June &#8211; in Barcelona for the [Sonar][7] festival
  * 22-25 June &#8211; off to the US to speak again on [Putting the BBC&#8217;s Programme Catalogue on Rails][8] at [RailsConf][9] in Chicago.
  * July/August &#8211; living and working in Amsterdam
  * 24-28 July &#8211; [OSCON][10] in Portland, Oregon (possibly)
  * 25 August until late October &#8211; California

Gosh, that looks like quite a lot now I&#8217;ve written it out. My trip to ETech, SXSW and London was just wonderful, and if I have even half as much fun and meet half as many awesome people on the next trip, I&#8217;ll be over the moon.
