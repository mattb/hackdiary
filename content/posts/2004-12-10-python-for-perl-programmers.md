Tomorrow I&#8217;m giving a talk at the rather wonderful [London Perl Workshop][1]. I&#8217;ve worked with quite a few languages in my time, including about 4 years or so of writing mostly perl. These days I write in python when I have a choice, so I&#8217;m going to give an introduction to python for perl programmers. [Here are the slides][2]. Nothing fancy, just the basics.

I&#8217;m most definitely not a GUI person, and I find Powerpoint quite distressing. I&#8217;m most happy authoring in VIM. This is the first time I&#8217;ve used [Eric Meyer&#8217;s S5][3] HTML slide templates, and it&#8217;s been a very satisfying experience.

If you&#8217;re at the workshop, do come and have a chat. Should be a great Saturday.
