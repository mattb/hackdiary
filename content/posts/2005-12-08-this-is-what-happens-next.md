The coding&#8217;s done on version 1.0 of the BBC Programme Catalogue and I&#8217;ve handed it over to the BBC for testing and deployment. Now I&#8217;m going snowboarding. I&#8217;ll be living in [Morzine][1] in the [French Alps][2] until the end of the winter.

I won&#8217;t be taking on any more commercial projects until I return to the UK at the end of the season in May 2006. As always, do [email me][3] before then if you have interesting things in mind. The nearest airport is Geneva; if you&#8217;re in the area, get in touch, hop on a shuttle bus and drop in for a cup of tea.
