RailsConf wrapped up this afternoon and I&#8217;m heading back to reality. Before I fly home to Amsterdam, I&#8217;m staying one night in actual downtown Chicago. It&#8217;s a great relief after so many nights in O&#8217;Hare Airportsville. Luckily the quality of the conference made up for the terrible location.

It&#8217;s been a fun and worthwhile trip that&#8217;s introduced me to a whole new community. Unlike an ETech or an XTech, there were only a few familiar faces from my usual conference circuit. I think I made a reasonable impression on my new friends with my talk on Saturday morning: [Putting the BBC&#8217;s Programme Catalogue on Rails][1]. There was a great turnout and people hung around after the talk to ask some very interesting and intelligent questions. I spotted [Martin Fowler][2] at the back of the room, which threw me for a few seconds. His books on refactoring and software patterns are essential reading for any developer and I have enormous respect for his opinions.

Without the audio, I&#8217;m afraid the slides are just a vague visual outline. There was a dedicated team recording the talks throughout the conference, and I&#8217;m told that the audio will be available soon. Sadly you&#8217;ll have to pay for access to this, although the cost may be justifiable judging from the quality of the talks that I was able to attend.
