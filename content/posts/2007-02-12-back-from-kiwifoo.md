I&#8217;ve just got back from another big trip. I&#8217;ve spent most of the last two weeks in New Zealand, thanks to [Nat Torkington][1] and the kind sponsorship of [New Zealand Trade and Enterprise][2]. Not only did I get to attend [NZ Foo Camp][3], but NZTE&#8217;s John Houlker arranged for me to meet with representives of Auckland and Wellington&#8217;s media, software and archiving interests.

I learnt a lot about the current state of broadband and digital strategy in NZ. I&#8217;m very grateful to [TV3][5], [TVNZ][6], [the National Library][7], [the Film Archive][8], [Telecom NZ][9], [Catalyst][10] and [Serato][11] for taking time to talk to me about my work with the [BBC Archives][12], [hardware prototyping][13] and [open data][14].

Foo Camp was tons of fun: the best of the three Foos I&#8217;ve been to, I think. There&#8217;s no way I can list every one of the fascinating people I met, but check [Planet NZTech][15] for pointers. Special mentions to [Jonathan Oxer][16] and [Phil Lindsay][17] who stayed up late with me on Saturday night [Bluetooth-enabling a toy car with Arduino][18].
