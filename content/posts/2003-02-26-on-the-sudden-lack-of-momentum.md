Just when I&#8217;d got into a regular rhythm of posting new stuff to this site at least once a week, my laptop died. For the last year or so I&#8217;ve stopped using desktop machines, partly prompted by the arrival of cheap wireless networking. A good laptop and a number of built-for-purpose servers (mp3 jukebox, network gateway and webserver, etc) have suited me very well.

I&#8217;ve blatted my savings and ordered a [shiny new replacement][1], but until that arrives I won&#8217;t be able to properly finish any of the code I&#8217;ve been working on. I&#8217;m looking forward to posting a new RDF [scutter][2] based on an updated version of the [foaftool][3] code posted here a few weeks ago.
