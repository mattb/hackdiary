For the last couple of months I&#8217;ve been working on a new project in my spare time. [Dopplr][1] is a social network for frequent travellers, designed to [increase the amount of serendipity in the world][2]. It lets you [share your travel plans with your trusted fellow travellers][3], and uses them to find the coincidences, near-misses and surprises. Maps, mobile, timelines, feeds, calendars: you can have the information pretty much any way you want it.

Dopplr&#8217;s still invite only, but there&#8217;s a good chance you know someone with an account by now. We&#8217;ll be issuing new invite tokens from time to time, so keep an eye out. There are [some screenshots on Flickr][4], and alpha travellers [Stowe Boyd][5] and [Roo Reynolds][6] have written some illuminating reviews. I&#8217;ll be at [XTech in Paris][7] in May (don&#8217;t forget, online registration closes soon) so track me down and I&#8217;ll give you a demo.

I&#8217;m having a great time making something of my own and collaborating with people whose skills and opinions I trust and respect. I showed the alpha release around ETech and SXSW and got some [great reactions][8]. We started inviting people in to test the app, a few at a time, and their feedback has been very encouraging.

Because I&#8217;m having so much fun and I want Dopplr to be as good as it can possibly be, I&#8217;ve taken the decision to suspend my freelancing and work on it full time. It seems they&#8217;ll let anyone be a CTO these days.

If you want to follow our day-to-day progress, I&#8217;m collecting [dopplr-related links and coverage on del.icio.us][9].
