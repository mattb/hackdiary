I&#8217;m off to [XML Europe][1] in a couple of weeks (better get in quick if you&#8217;re thinking of going, registration closes April 9th). I&#8217;ve been looking at the [schedule][2], which has lots of semantic web goodness in it, and thinking about what talks I&#8217;m going to go to. Here&#8217;s my list so far

<!--more-->

  
**[Take REST: An Analysis of Two REST APIS][3]**: Paul Prescod&#8217;s always interesting on this topic. I found his [writings on REST][4] convincing when I first discovered them a couple of years ago, and it was great to meet him at last year&#8217;s XML Europe in London.

**[Lessons From an XML Query-Qriven SVG+XHTML Web Site][5]**: always interesting to see how new technologies actually get used, rather than just sit listening to people talk through the specs. At a BOF at last year&#8217;s [WWW][6] conference, Liam and others were talking about the possibility of adapting [XQuery as a query language for RDF][7].

**[Topic Maps are Emerging &#8211; Why Should I Care?][8]**: because I don&#8217;t know enough about topic maps despite being an RDFhead.

**[Semantic Blogging: Spreading the Semantic Web Meme][9]**: I&#8217;ve never met Steve Cayzer, but I know several people from [ILRT][10] who&#8217;ve worked with him and it all sounds like interesting work. He&#8217;s on in the same session as [my talk][11], followed by [two][12] [more][13] fascinating semantic web talks from Damian Steer and Dave Beckett.

Hmm, **[RDF/XHTML: A New RDF Syntax][14]** or **[RDF, XForms, and the Law &#8211; Staying Out of Gaol][15]**?

[The tutorials][16] look rather good this year (Amazon web services, .NET and XML, XSLT2, XQuery, XML schemas, etc) but my employer didn&#8217;t have the money for me to attend. At least I&#8217;ll get to hear Jeff Barr at [his keynote][17].

Oh, and I just found out I&#8217;ve got the go-ahead to attend [www2004][18]. Anyone else going?
