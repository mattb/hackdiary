Last month I went along to the [Google Open Source Jam in London][1]. It was a very entertaining evening with a great crowd. At the last minute I decided to give a quick show-and-tell on the [work in progress][2] at [Nature][3].

[Jeremy Rayner][4] was kind enough to [upload some videos][5] that he took from the evening&#8217;s talks. Here is my two minutes:
