Thankfully, these days most people agree that XML is a decent way to exchange structured information, whatever its eventual form when it arrives in databases, content management systems or messaging architectures. When it comes to deciding on the exact XML representations for information however, opinions differ. Often a distinction is made between &#8216;document-centric&#8217; and &#8216;data-centric&#8217; approaches to modelling. Information that doesn&#8217;t boil down easily into a hierarchical structure calls for ways to make inter-element links across the XML tree. After enjoying a few [essays][1] and [conference talks][2] around the topic, and doing some XML schema design at work recently, I thought I&#8217;d try to document my own approach.
