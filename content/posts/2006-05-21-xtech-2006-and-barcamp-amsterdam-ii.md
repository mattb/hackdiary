[XTech 2006][1] and [Barcamp Amsterdam II][2] just wound up. It&#8217;s been a mind-expanding, productive and wonderfully fun week. It was my second time on the XTech programme committee, and my first ever Barcamp.

Looking back at the [schedule][3] and the [flickr][4] [photos][5] and taking stock, I&#8217;m even more thrilled about the lineup and the people than I was before it all started. I&#8217;m very proud that I could play a small part in putting together the XTech programme.

My talk (on the [BBC Programme Catalogue][6] work) and our tutorial on Ruby on Rails went pretty well according to the attendee evaluations. I saw a ton of really thought-provoking talks and got to hang out with some very smart and lovely people.

Even putting together a list of URLs so I could name-drop my old and new friends took about 15 minutes; here goes: [Marco Wessel][7], [Ulla-Maaria Mutanen][8], [Andy Smith][9], [Freeman Murray][10], [Suw Charman][11], [Paul Hammond][12], [Deb Bassett][13], [Rob Lee][14], [Tom Coates][15], [The Ryan King][16], [Brian Suda][17], [Ralph Meijer][18], [Thomas Vander Wal][19], [Uche Ogbuji][20], [Edd Dumbill][21], [Jeremy Keith][22], [Liz Turner][23], [Simon Willison][24], [Nat Downe][25], [Dave Beckett][26], [Matt Patterson][27], [Max Carlson][28], [Paul Prescod][29], [Libby Miller][30] and [Pete Ferne][31]. There were many more, and surely more still that I didn&#8217;t get a chance to meet. If you didn&#8217;t make it to either of the events, keep an eye out for the next time round. You won&#8217;t regret it.
