XML.com have just published an article I wrote for them last month entitled [REST On Rails][1].

<!--more-->

  
It outlines one approach that I&#8217;ve been developing for the API in the BBC programme catalogue. One of the things I like a great deal about Rails is its URL routing and dispatch mechanism. Creating mappings from URLs to model instances makes a resource-oriented style feel very natural, which sits very well with REST.

Isn&#8217;t this a wonderfully literal interpretation of the article&#8217;s title?
