There&#8217;s [a job][1] being advertised at BBC Radio and Music Interactive in London, where I work. It involves Python, XML, CMSes, digital radio and other interesting technologies. You&#8217;d like it there.

_UPDATE: Applications have now closed._

_FURTHER UPDATE: for unknown reasons, this page is (at the time of writing) number one hit on google for the search term [work at the bbc][2] (and perhaps some similar terms). For those who come here looking for work, I suggest you look at the [BBC Jobs site][3] or perhaps [BBC Talent][4], where budding writers, presenters and DJs are sought._
