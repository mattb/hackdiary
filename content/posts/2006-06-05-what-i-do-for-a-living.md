My name is Matt Biddulph. Since October 2005, I&#8217;ve been an independent freelancer, [open to new work][1]. I&#8217;m currently based in London but I&#8217;m open to travel and have worked remotely for clients in a number of countries. I specialise in the design of software systems for the internet. I have a particular interest in digital media, social software and data on the web.

I&#8217;m an experienced developer in most of the languages and systems you&#8217;d expect from more than ten years of work in the industry: Ruby (and Rails), Python, Java, Perl, Unix, databases, web servers and so forth. These days I spend as much time consulting on the design and modelling of systems as I do writing code for them. I write about my personal experiments in technology here on hackdiary, and it&#8217;s always a good reflection of my interests at any given time.

Before I went freelance, I spent several years working at the Press Association and the BBC. There&#8217;s a lot more about that period in [my CV][2].

### Notable freelance projects

#### [The Venice Project][3]

I consulted on the data model for programmes in this new social TV platform from the founders of Skype and Kazaa.

#### [Nature publishing group][4]

I created a system in [Second Life][5] for importing 3D models from real-world data created by the European Molecular Biology Lab.

I also developed a number of patches to Movabletype and modules for Ruby on Rails to enhance Nature&#8217;s ability to publish over XML/RPC and Atom Publishing Protocol in their internal editorial systems.

#### Ruby on Rails training

[Edd Dumbill][6] and I developed a two-day Ruby on Rails quickstart training programme which we taught at the XTech 2006 conference and at the BBC.

#### [BBC Programme Catalogue][7]

Using Ruby on Rails, I was the developer and information architect on the first public experimental prototype of the BBC Programme Catalogue. The site exposes the database of the BBC&#8217;s enormous archive to the internet via a search engine and web APIs.

#### [Thinglink][8]

Consulting on the technical architecture and implications of Thinglink, the free product code for creative work.

#### [Mobbu][9]

In just 5 days, built a prototype of a mobile application for local government in Ruby on Rails.
