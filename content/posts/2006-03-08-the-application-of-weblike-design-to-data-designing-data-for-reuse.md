My esteemed former colleague [Tom Coates][1] has been giving a talk recently entitled [Native to a Web of Data: Designing a Part of the Aggregate Web][2]. It&#8217;s a tour de force journey through key issues and implications of the renaissance in web thinking that&#8217;s happening right now.

In his talk, Tom very kindly references a talk I gave at last year&#8217;s [XTech][3] conference. It&#8217;s based on a great deal of work he and I did together at the BBC, and endless conversations that we&#8217;ve had on the nature of the web. It&#8217;s called [The Application of Weblike Design to Data: Designing Data for Reuse][4] and hopefully those slides are some use to those seeking background for Tom&#8217;s narrative.

I&#8217;m not living in London at the moment so I missed seeing Tom present at the recent Carson [Future of Web Apps][5] event. Luckily, they&#8217;ve made MP3s available of all the talks there, so you can hear the talk too. I just saw him speak at [ETech 2006][6], and I was blown away by the clarity, consistency and depth of the ideas. Don&#8217;t miss it.
