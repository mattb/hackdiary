I gave a developer-oriented version of my semantic web &#8220;photos and metadata&#8221; talk at www2003 developers day. The [slides][1] are available online and there are a bunch of demos to look at.

<!--more-->

  
The demos:

  * [Wordnet namespace entry for building][2]
  * [Picdiary home page][3]
  * [RSS for Picdiary home page][4]
  * [Picdiary polaroids view][5]
  * [Pictures of Edd Dumbill][6]
  * [Pictures of Edd Dumbill, RSS source][7]
  * [Wordnet-based search for skyscraper][8]
  * [Wordnet-based search for building][9]
  * [Wordnet-hierarchy-nav for structure][10]

The logs on the IRC #www2003 channel [during the talk][11] are interesting to compare with the slides.
