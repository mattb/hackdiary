This morning I did my talk ([A Semantic Web Shoebox &#8211; Annotating Photos with RSS and RDF][1]) at [XMLEurope 2003][2]. The slides are now [available][3].

The talk was scheduled amongst a fun-packed Semantic Web series of [Celia Romaniuk][4] (Soap Operas and the Semantic Web), [Uche Ogbuji][5] (Akara &#8211; Part Wiki, Part Blog, Powered by XML and RDF), [Jo Walsh][6] (Collaborative Mapping with RDF) and myself.
