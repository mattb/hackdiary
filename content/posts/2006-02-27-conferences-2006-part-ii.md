Time has flown, and I&#8217;ve only got two months left before the winter season is over and the snowboarding is done. It&#8217;s time to get on a plane again and reconnect a little with the tech world.

Here&#8217;s my itinerary for the next three weeks:

  * 4 March: London
  * 5 March: [Amtrak Surfliner][2] from LA to San Diego
  * 6-10 March: San Diego for [ETech][3]
  * 10-15 March: Austin for [SXSW Interactive][4]
  * 15-19 March: A suite at the excellent [Farmer&#8217;s Daughter Hotel][5] in LA
  * 20-? March: A few days back in London before returning to the Alps

As usual, [get in touch][6] if you fancy meeting up anywhere along the trail.
