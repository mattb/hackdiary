Last night I gave a [lightning talk][1] at the [london.pm techmeet][2] that attempted to explain as simply as possible what RDF and the Semantic Web are, and how you can start playing with them with perl.

The [slides][3] (in PDF created using [AxPoint][4]) are brief but hopefully useful. At the same meeting, [Celia][5] talked about her work at the BBC on modelling [Eastenders][6] plots in RDF and [Jo][7] talked about [spacenamespace, mudlondon and collaborative mapping][8]. It was great to chat to people in the pub afterwards and see a lot of enthusiasm for the ideas.
