I&#8217;m on the road again. On Thursday March 1st I&#8217;m flying to San Francisco and I&#8217;ll be in the USA for the whole month.

While I&#8217;m there, I&#8217;ll be hanging out at the usual places &#8211; I&#8217;m staying in the Mission so it&#8217;ll be [Ritual Roasters][2] by default. I&#8217;ll also be at the following events:

  * [SXSW][3] (including Music for the first time this year)
  * [IA Summit][4] (on a [Web Of Data panel][5] with Tom Coates and friends)
  * [ETech][6]

I hope I see you there.
