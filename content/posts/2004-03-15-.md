Unlike a lot of RDF data, which uses URIs as identifiers, [FOAF][1] makes use of [Inverse Functional Properties][2] in order to identify people. This means that we don&#8217;t have to agree on a canonical URI to represent someone, we just need to mention some attribute that could belong only to them (their email address, for example). While this is great for simplifying the creation of FOAF data, it does bring headaches when you come to write an aggregator. RDF toolkits automatically merge RDF data by URI into a single graph, but only a few systems implement enough of OWL to merge on IFPs (informally known as [smushing][3]).

When writing the semantic web crawler that forms the basis of my [XML Europe paper][4], I reworked the algorithms I&#8217;ve [worked on in the past][5] to perform smushing on large stores of RDF. The new version works incrementally &#8211; for each new document added to the store, it needs only to inspect the triples in that document and consult a lookup table. This means it can even run in setups where the crawler isn&#8217;t directly connected to the store.

The main operation of a smushing algorithm is to rewrite RDF statements in order to merge two or more nodes once it is discovered that they refer to the same entity. The decision to do this rewriting is taken when a statement is found stating an IFP of a subject. If we&#8217;ve seen a subject before with the same IFP, this new subject should be rewritten to match the previous subject.

The basic principle of minimal-state iterative smushing is simply this: keep a lookup table of previous decisions rather than scanning the store to discover the canonical subject for a given IFP.
