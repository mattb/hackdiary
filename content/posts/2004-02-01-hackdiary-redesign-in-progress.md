It&#8217;s time to rework the hackdiary site and get rid of the nasty design that reeks of a lazy movabletype user. The HTML could do with a tidy-up too. It&#8217;ll probably look a bit broken for now.

It&#8217;s now about 80% of the way there, with a colour scheme inspired by a [photo of a warning sign][1] that I took somewhere in East London last year.
