It&#8217;s that time of year again &#8211; today is your last chance to put in a proposal for XTech 2008 in Dublin. You can read all about it in the [Call for Participation][1]. This year, along with the traditional core Web and XML technologies of XTech, we&#8217;re focusing on &#8220;The Web on the Move&#8221; &#8211; the emerging portability of data, applications and identity on the internet.

I&#8217;m writing my proposal today &#8211; I&#8217;m planning on pulling the very loose ramble I presented at Barcamp London on [messaging architectures][2] into a proper talk. For 2008 I&#8217;m very excited about [Erlang][3], [XMPP][4], message brokers such as [ActiveMQ][5] and clientside messaging with [Comet][6]. The future&#8217;s asynchronous and highly concurrent.

I&#8217;m looking forward to the face-to-face conversations of the upcoming conference season. Working on [Dopplr][7] didn&#8217;t leave much time for writing in 2007, and that&#8217;s not going to change in the near future. Right now my online tech output is most confined to [tiny][8] [fragments][9] of [ideas][10] on [Twitter][11] and random pictures on Flickr (Nokia N810 unboxing; [Jawbone unboxing][12]).</p>
