We can explore the relationships between people by analysing, clustering, ranking and visualising their social graphs. These techniques are now very familiar from studies of Facebook, Twitter and Google+. However, the majority of these graph algorithms don&#8217;t actually care whether the nodes in their networks are people or not. I&#8217;ve been exploring whether we can apply these same approaches to other graphs.

Can we gather the data for it from existing social systems on the internet? If so, can there be a PageRank or a Klout for cities? Can we use it to draw new maps of the world based on how people use it, and ignoring geography?

This is what I got:
