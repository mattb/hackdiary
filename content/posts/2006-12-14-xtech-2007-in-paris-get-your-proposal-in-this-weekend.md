The call for proposals for [XTech 2007][1] is closing this weekend. Last year&#8217;s conference was superb, and if you&#8217;ve got anything to say about making the web then you&#8217;ll definitely want to be part of next year&#8217;s lineup.

_The theme for this year&#8217;s conference is &#8220;The Ubiquitous Web&#8221;. As the web reaches further into our lives, we will consider the increasing ubiquity of connectivity, what it means for real world objects to connect to the web, and the increasing blurring of the lines between virtual worlds and our own._

_The technologies underpinning these developments include mobile devices, RFID, ultra-wideband, Second Life, location-aware services, Google Earth and more. The issues surrounding them include privacy, intellectual property, activism, politics, regulation and standards._

A special mention for some of the talks I particularly liked last year:

  * [An open (data) can of worms by Paul Hammond, Yahoo][2] 
  * [Hijax: Progressive Enhancement with Ajax by Jeremy Keith, Clearleft][3]
  * [The power of declarative thinking by Steven Pemberton, W3C][4]
  * [Ignorance is not a defense by Suw Charman, Open Rights Group][5]
