I just got back from [XTech 2007][1] in Paris. It was an excellent conference this year and I&#8217;m really proud of having contributed in a small way by being on the programme committee. Every year the speaker lineup gets better and better.

The theme this year was &#8216;The Ubiquitous Web&#8217;. HTTP isn&#8217;t just for computers any more, and I&#8217;m particularly interested in how developers like me can learn to make their own network-connected objects in the real world. To spread the word, I gave a [lightning talk][2] on my experiences with the [Arduino][3] hardware hacking boards and other toys from [tinker.it][4].

I put the slides [on SlideShare][5].
