Today I discovered that a new module, [Triplestore.pm][1], has appeared on CPAN. To my surprise, my [triplequerying algorithm][2] is cited at the end of the documentation. Looking through the code, it&#8217;s not directly built on the sample code I provided. The implementation looks way cleaner, and has many more features beyond querying. I&#8217;m overjoyed to have had some part in this.
