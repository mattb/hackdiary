The [XTech 2006 Call For Participation][1] has just been published, and you should be submitting something. You have until January 9th 2006.

XTech is a superb European tech conference covering internet, XML, browser and open data technologies. This year&#8217;s conference has a Web 2.0 flavour &#8211; think AJAX, tagging, identity, digital rights, owning your own data and opening up information for reuse. Don&#8217;t think business models, think really great demos.

I had a great time at last year&#8217;s conference &#8211; check out [last year&#8217;s schedule][2] for a flavour of what went on. I&#8217;m proud to be on the programme committee again this year.

The Krasnapolsky Hotel, also recently home to Euro OSCon, is a top class venue right in the middle of Amsterdam. See you there in May 2006.
