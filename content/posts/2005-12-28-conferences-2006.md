I&#8217;m on [sabbatical][1], but when an interesting conference like [LIFT06][2] is being organised a bus-ride away from my chalet, I think I have to make an exception. I&#8217;ve made my booking &#8211; are you going too? [Let me know][3].

Otherwise, see you at XTech &#8211; have you got [your proposal][4] in yet?
