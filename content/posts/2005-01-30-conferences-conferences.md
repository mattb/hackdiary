Two conferences are looming large on my radar this week. I&#8217;m speaking at [Emerging Technology][1], which happens in San Diego in March, and I&#8217;m on the Program Committee for [XTech 2005][2] in Amsterdam in May. Early registration is still open for both conferences (although the O&#8217;Reilly one closes very soon).

The ETech talks are called [BBC Programme Information Pages: An Architecture for an On-Demand World][3] and  
[Reinventing Radio: Enriching Broadcast with Social Software][4]. It&#8217;s notable that this is the first time that I&#8217;m talking on BBC topics at a major conference, despite having been employed by the corporation for nearly four years. This is in no small part due to my move to the Radio and Music division, where many clues are to be found. My co-conspirators on these papers are names to be reckoned with.

I&#8217;ve submitted a proposal for XTech: _&#8220;The Application Of Weblike Design To Data&#8221; &#8211; Designing Data For Reuse_. We&#8217;re reviewing papers at the moment, and the quality is high. Looks like it&#8217;ll be a superb conference, and I&#8217;m particularly excited about the new &#8216;Browser Technology&#8217; and &#8216;Open Data&#8217; tracks.
