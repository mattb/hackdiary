The nice people at O&#8217;Reilly invited me to Foo Camp this year. On August 24th I&#8217;ll be packing up my bags and leaving Amsterdam for sunny California.

After Foo Camp, I&#8217;m planning to stay in San Francisco until at least mid-October, and (having worked my arse off for the last couple of months) I&#8217;m going to be able to mostly treat it as a holiday.

Shockingly, I&#8217;ve never visited San Francisco before, so I&#8217;m looking out to my extended network for fun people to meet, exciting companies to visit, and places to stay in SF.

If anyone has a housemate who&#8217;s going to be out of town, a geek apartment they want to sublet or just a comfy couch they can lend me for a few nights, please do [let me know][1]. Tips on cheap hotels also very much appreciated.

This is going to be so much fun. Hope I see you in California.
