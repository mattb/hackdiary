I&#8217;m Matt Biddulph ([@mattb][1]). I&#8217;m based in San Francisco. I work at [Apple][2]. I was the co-founder of [Thington][3] ([acquired by eero][4] in 2017) and of [Dopplr][5] ([acquired by Nokia][6] in 2009).

My interests include:

  * AI on low-powered devices
  * building resilient distributed applications at scale
  * playing and [building modular synthesizers][7]
  * [hardware hacking][8] and [the Internet Of Things][9]
  * building products from data, particularly [the analysis of text and graph-oriented information][10]
  * [social networks][11]
  * [geographic information systems][12]
  * [rapid product prototyping with data][13]

[Contact me][14] if you are interested in working together.

I help organise [Science Hack Day San Francisco][15], a 48-hour-all-night event where anyone excited about making weird, silly or serious things with science comes together in the same physical space to see what they can prototype within 24 consecutive hours. I take quite a [lot][16] of [pictures][17] and write quite a lot of [code][18]. I [speak at conferences][19].

I used to work at Nokia, where I was the Head of Data Strategy for Location and Commerce Applications. I was co-founder and CTO of [Dopplr][5], a social network for frequent travellers acquired by Nokia in 2009. From 2001 to 2005 I worked at the BBC in Radio and Music Interactive, where I was leader of the software architecture team, aka Head of Plugging Things Into Other Things. As a freelancer over the years I have worked with the [UK Government Digital Service][20], [nature.com][21], [lastminute.com][22], [BERG][23] and [Xively][24].
